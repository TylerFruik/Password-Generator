# Module 3 | JavaScript Challenge | Password Generator

## Finished Product

### [ðŸ”—Project Link](https://tylerfruik.github.io/Password-Generator/)
This project involved building upon pre-laid-out code using HTML, CSS, and JS. Using all three, repairs must be made to a Password Generator.
When functioning properly, the Password Generator will produce a copyable custom line of text that fits the user's parameters.
Users are able to select the 'Uppercase', 'Lowercase', 'Numbers', and 'Symbols' parameters along with a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
The 'Generate Password' button's functionality is locked until at least one of the four parameter buttons have been selected.
Upon clicking, a 'Secure Password' is generated in the space at the bottom that matches the requested criteria!
This page is responsive to resizing and the code is well annotated.

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files as well as all necessary images in the /Assets/images/ folder.

All additions to base-code written manually by Tyler Fruik

- Slider does not get smaller with resizing.
